; Lines beginning with a semicolon (;) are ignored by FDSTools.

[aliases]
; Assign an explicit allele name to a specific sequence of a specific marker.
; Specify three comma-separated values: marker name, sequence, and allele name.
; You may use the alias name in the flanks, prefix, and suffix sections to
; specify them for this allele specifically. You cannot specify a repeat
; structure for an alias.
; AmelX    = Amel, GAT, X
; AmelY    = Amel, AATAAAGTG, Y

[flanks]
; The flanking sequences (e.g., primer sequences) of each marker. Specify two
; comma-separated values: left flank and right flank, in the same sequence
; orientation (strand).
Arm01   = TTACAATGTGTGTGCCTGCG, AGGAGTTCTCATTTGATCCTTTCC
Arm03   = TCAGGAAGTTTGCCCCTCTC, TTGCTGCGCAATGGGTTTAC
Arm04   = ACTTGCATGTAGAGACGGATG, GTGGAGTCGGAACTTAACCG
Arm06   = TGTCGCCTCAATCCTTGGTG, GCTGAAGTCCTTCCTTGGAC
Arm07   = ACATGACGCAAAAAGCGTAG, CCATGTTACCACCATGTCGC
Arm08   = AGATGAGGTTCTTGCAGCATC, TGCTTGCAGTTGAAGTAAAGGG
Arm11   = TGGCACAAGGTATGTGTTGC, TCTTCGACCGAATGTTTTCACC


[prefix]
; Specify all known prefix sequences of each STR marker, separated by commas.
; The prefix is the sequence between the left flank and the repeat and is
; omitted from allele names. The first sequence listed is used as the reference
; sequence for that marker when generating allele names. Deviations from the
; reference are expressed as variants.

[suffix]
; Specify all known suffix sequences of each STR marker, separated by commas.
; The suffix is the sequence between the repeat and the right flank. The first
; sequence listed is used as the reference sequence for that marker when
; generating allele names.


[repeat]
; Specify the repeat structure of each STR marker in space-separated triples of
; sequence, minimum number of repeats, and maximum number of repeats.
Arm01   = CATA 0 30
Arm03   = TACA 0 30
Arm04   = CATA 0 30
Arm06   = ACAT 0 30
Arm07   = TATG 0 30
Arm08   = TGTA 0 30
Arm11   = GT 0 30


[length_adjust]
; To prevent discrepancies between traditional CE allele numbers and the CE
; number in FDSTools allele names, the CE allele number as calculated by
; FDSTools is based on the length of the sequence (prefix+repeat+suffix) minus
; the adjustment specified here.
; D1S1656  =  8
; D22S1045 = -9

[block_length]
; Specify the repeat unit length of each STR marker. The default length is 4.
Arm01   = 4
Arm03   = 4
Arm04   = 4
Arm06   = 4
Arm07   = 4
Arm08   = 4
Arm11   = 2


[max_expected_copies]
; Specify the maximum expected number of copies (i.e., alleles) for each marker
; in a single reference sample (only used for allelefinder). The default is 2.
; Specify 1 here for haploid markers (i.e., those on the Y chromosome).
; DYS391   = 1

[expected_allele_length]
; Specify one or two values for each marker. The first value gives the expected
; minimum length (in nucleotides, including prefix and suffix, excluding
; flanks) of the alleles and the second value (if given) specifies the maximum
; allele length expected for that marker (both inclusive). TSSV will filter
; sequences that have a length outside this range.
