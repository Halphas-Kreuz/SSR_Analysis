oki let's start with the new shell script. 

#for the main and bigger script, I will need following work to be done in sequence: 
1. after the first run of SSRseq shell, create a new folder called filtered_part in the same path 
2. run the name cleaner (optimal? maybe the name problem do only occur in my case) three times
3. run the filter script for each file : 
    - for the stuttermark : keep the first 2 candidates for each locus
    - for the tssvResult : keep the first 2 candidates for each locus 
    - for the tssvReports : extract the sum of the sequence for this loci 
4. make the three things together as a document , then analyse 

Now I have all the material for step3 , then how to fuse them together ?
