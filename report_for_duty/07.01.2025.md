Reading the SSRseqPolyploids which has perl code. 
the online version of tool is here : http://bioinfo.geneskybiotech.com/software/ssrseq_type/v1.1/en/ 

(update: no, it is not this one.)

In one word for its work method : count the frequency, highlight the seq which has higher freq than threshold, then HIGHLIGHT THEM FOR MANUAL WORK 

okay, semi-automatic.
