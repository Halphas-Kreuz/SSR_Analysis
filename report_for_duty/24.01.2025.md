yesterday failed to save.

Still it is not clear why the script does not work again.

1. after the first run of SSRseq shell, create a new folder called filtered_part in the same path 
2. run the name cleaner (optimal? maybe the name problem do only occur in my case) three times
3. run the filter script for each file : 
    - for the stuttermark : keep the first 2 candidates for each locus
    - for the tssvResult : keep the first 2 candidates for each locus 
    - for the tssvReports : extract the sum of the sequence for this loci 
4. make the three things together as a document , then analyse 

for the step 3, now fetch the locusCoverage , and use search loop for each round.
Still... why is it so ,just change the name of the source and then suddenly the script does not work?

I have checked the reverse part. it is exactly as I change, but how is it like so, the script now is like empty?

now it works. 
I maybe need to hardcode the virtual environment start into the script .
Everytime I forgot it ...
And later I need to give a special input format for the input. 
maybe just like Sample -> subnumber ?
